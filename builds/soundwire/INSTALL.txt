SoundWire Server Install Instructions for Linux
-----------------------------------------------

System Requirements:

- Open firewall ports 59010 & 59011 UDP. You may do this from the GUI using
  Firewall or a similar utility.

- Install Pulse Audio Volume Control (pavucontrol) using your package manager.
  You may do this from the GUI using "Add/Remove Programs" or a similar utility.
  From the command line use "sudo yum install pavucontrol" on Red Hat/Fedora, or
  "sudo apt-get install pavucontrol" on Debian/Ubuntu.

- Install portaudio using your package manager, or from
  http://www.portaudio.com/download.html
  If your Linux distribution has the libportaudio2 package it will work
  as well.

- Install libcurl package.

- Continue with the steps below. Install any other packages needed to satisfy
  shared library dependencies if SoundWireServer fails to start. You should run
  it from the command line to see any error messages. Note that Portaudio
  usually displays a large number of errors, so these are suppressed unless you
  specify the -verbose option when running SoundWireServer.

SoundWire Server Installation:

1. Add the directory containing these files to your search path. (You can skip
   this step if you run SoundWireServer from the command line using the full
   path.)

2. At this point you can start SoundWire Server from the command line by typing
   SoundWireServer. To run without a GUI or if your system has no X server
   use the -nogui option. To start it from the GNOME desktop do the steps below.

3. Copy the icon file sw-icon.xpm to directory ~/.icons or some other standard
   location for icons.

4. Copy the GNOME launcher file SoundWire-Server.desktop anywhere you like,
   e.g. your desktop. Copy it to /usr/share/applications to appear in the GNOME
   apps menu.

You may need to modify these instructions if you use KDE or as per your Linux
distribution.
